This is a collection of tests based on https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/ 
All tests are written in JavaScript using PlayWright
By default, the tests are only using firefox as a browser - if you want to use other browsers, un-comment the browser lines in playwright.config.js

Some commands to run the tests:
npx playwright test                runs in headless mode by default
npx playwright test --headed       runs in headed mode to see what is happening and how
npx playwright test
